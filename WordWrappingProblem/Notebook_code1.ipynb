    "All possible solution for word wrapping problem is the same as number of partitioning an array with the same sort and partitioning problem is in exponential family. But there is a better algorithm with dynamic programming method. Firsto we define a $n$ by $n$ matrix which $n$ is total number of words in our sequence and we call it \"Line Cost Matrix\". Each element $Line Cost Matrix_{i,j}$ is cost of putting i'th word to j'th word in one line. The formula for cost is given by:\n",
    "$$Line Cost Matrix_{i,j} = \\Bigg[M - (j - i) - \\sum \\limits _{k = i} ^ {j} |word_{k}|\\Bigg] ^ 3$$\n",
    "If this cost is negative, we set it to positive infinity to discard it as a solution. If this value is positive but $j$ equals $n$, it means we are in last line and it doesn't have any cost, so we set it to zero and in other cases we set it to the number we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we define a variable $C_{i}$ that is minimum total cost if we use word from $1$ to $i$. For minimum we must check different $C_{k} + Line Cost Matrix_{k,i}$ values that $k = 1,2,...,i$. For gettnig $C_{i}$ we need values of $C_{1},C_{2},...,C_{i-1}$. By use of dynammic programming we can build array $C$ from left to right. The index that make the minimum cost is kept in another array $Break Points$ for showing the result. We define a function which receives all words and this array to build the paragraph. This function start from last index and the value of it is the index of last line starter. Then we go for second line from bottom and ending word is in index of previous starter and index of second line starter is the value of new ending index."
